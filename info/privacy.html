what information may
be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may
disclose the information
to third parties.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and

information is to
better understand how our visitors use our website.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the
aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of our website.</p>
<p>We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses
for logged in users and for users leaving comments on blog posts.</p>
<p>We only disclose logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
circumstances
that we use and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

<p>Certain visitors to this website choose to interact in ways that
require us to
gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that we gather depends
on the nature of

to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest
to you. This

advertisers.</p>

the database, so we invite you to wait a reasonable time, in which you may receive service-related announcements.</p>
